## 🛠️ How It Works
- The **ball** starts at the center and moves at an angle.
- If the ball hits the top or bottom wall, it **bounces**.
- If the ball hits a **paddle**, it speeds up!
- The **AI paddle** reacts dynamically, trying to keep up with the ball speed.
- If a player **misses the ball**, the opponent scores a point.
- The first to **10 points** wins the game!

---

## 🏆 Want to Win Against the AI? 🧠
- **Fake it out!** Move your paddle unpredictably.
- **Time your shots.** Let the AI struggle to keep up.
- **Use angles.** Redirect the ball for tricky bounces.
